## Project Context

The Kite MCP server is a Go implementation that integrates the Kite Connect trading API with the Model Context Protocol. This allows AI assistants to interact with the Kite trading platform via structured tools.

The primary components include:

- Tool definitions for various trading operations
- Handlers for processing requests and responses
- API integrations with the Kite Connect platform
- Authentication and session management
- Error handling and validation logic

## Development Tasks You Can Help With

1. **Adding New Tools**: Implementing new tools to extend functionality
2. **Debugging Existing Code**: Identifying and fixing issues
3. **Optimizing Performance**: Improving efficiency and reducing latency
4. **Enhancing Error Handling**: Making errors more informative and robust
5. **Writing Tests**: Creating unit and integration tests
6. **Documentation**: Improving code comments and external documentation
7. **Security Enhancements**: Identifying and addressing security concerns
8. **Code Refactoring**: Improving structure and maintainability
9. **API Integration**: Adding support for new Kite Connect API endpoints
10. **Configuration Management**: Improving how the application handles settings

## Guidelines for Assistance

When helping with development:

1. **Understand First**: Always make sure you understand the current code and its purpose before suggesting changes.

2. **Follow Go Best Practices**: Adhere to Go idioms and conventions, including proper error handling, meaningful comments, and efficient memory usage.

3. **Consider Context**: Remember that this is a financial API integration. Security, accuracy, and reliability are paramount.

4. **Provide Complete Solutions**: When suggesting code changes, provide complete, working implementations that can be directly integrated.

5. **Explain Your Reasoning**: Always explain the rationale behind your design decisions and implementation choices.

6. **Gradual Improvements**: Favor incremental, testable changes over large rewrites when possible.

7. **Keep It Consistent**: Follow the existing code style and patterns unless there's a compelling reason to deviate.

8. **Think About Error Cases**: Financial applications need robust error handling. Consider all possible failure modes.

## MCP Core Concepts

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is designed to enable AI models to interact with external tools in a structured way:

1. **Tools**: Discrete functions with defined parameters and return values
2. **Handlers**: Functions that process tool invocations and return results
3. **Parameters**: Structured inputs required by tools
4. **Schemas**: Definitions of what data a tool accepts and returns
5. **Sessions**: Context for a series of interactions

## Example MCP Tool Implementation

When implementing a new tool, follow this pattern:

```go
// Define the tool struct
type NewFeatureTool struct{}

// Implement the Tool interface
func (t *NewFeatureTool) Tool() gomcp.Tool {
    return gomcp.Tool{
        Name:        "new_feature",
        Description: "Description of what this tool does",
        Parameters: gomcp.Parameters{
            Type: "object",
            Properties: map[string]gomcp.Property{
                "param1": {
                    Type:        "string",
                    Description: "Description of parameter 1",
                },
                // Add more parameters as needed
            },
            Required: []string{"param1"},
        },
    }
}

// Implement the handler
func (t *NewFeatureTool) Handler(manager *kc.Manager) server.ToolHandlerFunc {
    return func(args map[string]interface{}) (interface{}, error) {
        // 1. Extract and validate parameters
        param1 := assertString(args["param1"])
        if param1 == "" {
            return nil, errors.New("param1 is required")
        }

        // 2. Get the client from the manager
        client := manager.GetClient()
        if client == nil {
            return nil, errors.New("not logged in")
        }

        // 3. Call the API and handle the response
        result, err := client.SomeAPICall(param1)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("API call failed: %w", err)
        }

        // 4. Format and return the response
        return result, nil
    }
}
```

## Common Project Patterns

- Use the `assertX` functions for type conversions of tool parameters
- Implement error handling that provides meaningful messages to the user
- Use the `manager.GetClient()` to access the Kite client in tool handlers
- Register new tools in the `ToolList` global variable in `mcp.go`
- Group related tools in appropriate files (e.g., `market_tools.go`, `post_tools.go`)

## Testing Your Implementation

When adding new functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interaction with the Kite API (consider mocking external calls)
3. **Manual Testing**: Test through the Claude or other AI interface
4. **Error Case Testing**: Deliberately pass invalid inputs to ensure proper error handling

## Deployment Considerations

When making changes that will be deployed:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
2. **Resource Usage**: Consider memory and CPU usage, especially for high-volume operations
3. **API Rate Limits**: Be aware of Kite Connect API rate limits and design accordingly
4. **Error Logging**: Ensure errors are properly logged for debugging
5. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration rather than hardcoding values
